# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

## Project Description

The project is a RESTful API designed to manage a collection of clothing items. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) clothing items while ensuring robust error handling and input validation. The API is built with Node.js and Express.js, and utilizes MongoDB as the database, with Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library. Postman is used for testing and interacting with the API during development.
`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## Technologies Used

Node.js: Backend runtime for building the API.
Express.js: Framework for routing and middleware support.
MongoDB: Database for storing clothing item records.
Mongoose: ODM library for schema modeling and database interaction.
Postman: Tool for testing and debugging API endpoints.

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
